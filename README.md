# game-of-life

Game of life is a concept created by John Conway, that basing on simple rules tries to simulate evolution.
I have created this project in 2021 to train c++ and test out SDL graphic library. 
Currently simulated shapes are hard-coded, Gosper glider gun - which is an example of a shape that continuously
creates glider shapes that propagate in right down direction. Other shape is just a square, that is a still shape
and will stay there until disrupted. I am planning on adding simple editor that let's user stop the simulation and 
modify cells and also pattern templates that the user will be able to just "paste".
This program is based on a tutorial from Let's Make Games Channel

i have followed a tutorial to a certain point, and then i decided to diverge from the project presented
in the tutorial and just make something new on my own.
